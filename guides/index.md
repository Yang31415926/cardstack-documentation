## What is Cardstack?

From a developer perspective, Cardstack is a framework that enables Web 3.0.

“Cards” form the building blocks that allow for bringing in data from disparate sources, beautiful UI animations, encapsulated and flexible data schemas, and a quick ramp-up experience.

## About the Guides

These work-in-progress documentation resources provide a high level overview of features, the project architecture, how to use Cardstack to power your own creations, and some pointers for developers who are working on the framework itself.

These pages are not designed to be very detailed *API documentation. Cardstack is pre-1.0, so there may be some inconsistencies in the documentation, and APIs are subject to change as we iterate, explore, and build new features.

## Contributing

As an Open Source project, Cardstack welcomes participation from the community! There should be a pencil icon at the top right of every page that will allow you to edit this documentation so please feel free to contribute if you know how to make things a bit better.
